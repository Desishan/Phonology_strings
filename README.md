# Phonology_strings

One similar project I've found: https://langnhist.weebly.com/phonoTOC.html
This program does similar things to what I'm doing with phonology_strings
using hard-coded data. However, I'm not intending my version to be
language-specific with hard-coded phonological rules, but rather to be a
playground linguists can use to test their ideas of potential phonological
rules, taking them as user input and displaying results using on a database
of information about the phonetic features of particular sounds.

This Reddit thread https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/48126/what-software-for-interpreting-phonological-rules-exists
discusses other related projects, some of which may be more like mine,
but I have yet to learn about them in detail.

I'm testing the program using data from Campbell's Historical Linguistics 3E,
an Instruction Manual.

I am using a Unicode 6.2 keyboard on Mac to type in IPA.
